The aim of the Terrorists is to murder the PM before the end of the round. Generally rounds last for 15 minutes, but it is dependent on the map. You can see the time left on the timer in the top center of the screen.\n\nThe round ends if one of the following happens:\n- The timer reaches 0 and the PM is still alive\n- The PM is killed (bad guys win)"}

Each map is slightly different in design requiring tactics to be varied depending on which map is being played. The aim of the terrorists is to hunt down and kill the PM before the end of the round.\n\n The game has several classes, divided into 5 teams. All classes in the same team spawn in the same \"base\". Within each team, the different classes have different weapons. Some classes have special \"medic\" powers, and usually spawn with less weaponry. Medics have a slightly paler colour so you can identify them on the radar.\n\nThere is an unarmed \"Prime Minister\" (PM) class (yellow). Closely guarding the Prime Minister is the \"bodyguard\" team (green), consisting of all the bodyguard classes. Then there are the more heavily-armed \"cops\" (blue). The \"good guys\" are allies, they fight united against the \"terrorists\" (pink) team. There are also \"psychos\" (orange) who can kill whoever they like and generally mess around."}

You can see where these are by looking for the red lines on the F11 map or on the radar.\n\nFor the majority of the maps, the PM's health recharges 1% every 5 seconds.\n Medics' health also recharges, but at a faster rate (only on specific maps). Medics can transfer some of their health to other players using /heal\n\n\nSome maps have a series of optional tasks for the PM to do, marked on the map by red blips. While completing these tasks will not guarantee victory (they can be ignored if you wish), a useful bonus will be given to the PM for each completed task. It is in the best interest of the Terrorists to stop all tasks from being completed. When a task is being attempted, the task blip on the radar will turn green to indicate it is being used. A small description of the task and a countdown will also appear on the screen to show how long left until completion (Psychos cannot see this).\n\n\nSome maps also have a series of objectives for the PM to complete. So rather than simply staying alive, the PM must complete all the objectives within the round or he will lose. The current objective will be shown on the radar as a red blip and announced on the screen. Unlike tasks, no information about the time needed to complete the objective will be shown to the Terrorists, so they must act fast to stop the PM."}
