<help>
This is a resource allowing you to jump, grab and hang onto parts of helicopters
To grab on to a helicopter, you must be standing with your hands close to the helicopter rails and execute the grab command

By default, you can do this with the following commands:
/grab (grabs onto a helicopter)
/drop (drops off a helicopter)

These commands are also bound to the keys 'jump' (grab) and 'backspace' (drop) by default

The key binds can be modified in the binds menu in the MTA settings

You can also bind the commands to keys yourself with:
/bind key state command (eg: "/bind lshift down grab")
