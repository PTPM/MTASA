# Readable license
This document specifies your rights and responsibilities if you distribute, modify, exploit or otherwise use the source 
code of Spark's Protect The Prime Minister (PTPM). This document is meant as a readable summary, but also includes the
official copyright notice. The attached GNU GPLv3 license is the official legal document that applies.

The license applies to both the source code, as well as the intellectual property and design of the software.

## Copyright

Ownership of the PTPM Source Code belongs to the administrators of the [PTPM Group on Github](https://github.com/PTPM).

## Summary of license
PTPM is open source software licensed under GNU GPLv3, as stated on the 
[Github repository](https://github.com/PTPM/MTASA/blob/master/LICENSE). As long as you agree to the conditions, the 
license grants you the following rights:
* To use the source code on your gaming server
* To use parts of the source code on your gaming server
* To distribute the code under GNU GPLv3
* To modify the code
* Commercial use is permitted and usage is royalty-free

If you use the code in any way, you agree to the following conditions:
* If your game is largely based on PTPM, you must make that project open source as well.
* Any derivative work must also be released under the license "GNU GPLv3".
* You must specify the changes to the PTPM source code.
* The copyright notice must be visible where-ever included in the source code, and on a publicly viewable page
or section of the software. Instead, you may also include a notice in a command named `/credits` or similar.

The license explicitly states that the software is provided without warranty and the software author/license owner 
cannot be held liable for damages.

And as always, exceptions may be made by the Owner of the project to grant a more permissive license.
